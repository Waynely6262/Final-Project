# CISC 121 Final Project

## Demonstration




### Step 1 - Choose an Algorithm & Justification
For this project, I chose quick-sort. It is the only algorithm that wasn't covered in high school. This algorithm sorts elements in an interesting way, which makes it a good reason to create a visualization for it.

### Step 2 - Plan Using Computational Thinking

#### Decomposition
The algorithm requires some components:
- A range-specific iterator
- An array reorganizer

The interface should support the following input, for some purpose:
- booleans will allow the user to choose some options that modify the behaviour of the algorithm
- 

#### Pattern Recognition
Each time a new pivot is chosen, the same operation is performed. There can be some callable method that will make code simpler

#### Abstraction
Every time the array is updated, the visualization should update based on the indexes that were changed.

#### Algorithm
